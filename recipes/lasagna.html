    <h2>recipe</h2>
    <p>You’ll find the full, step-by-step recipe below — but here’s a brief overview of what you can expect when you make porcupine meatballs: </p>
    <h2>ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound lean ground beef</li>
        <li>½ cup uncooked long grain white rice</li>
        <li>½ cup water</li>
        <li>⅓ cup chopped onion</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon celery salt</li>
        <li>⅛ teaspoon garlic powder</li>
        <li>⅛ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>step</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
        <li>Mix ground beef, rice, water, onion, salt, celery salt, garlic powder, and black pepper thoroughly in a bowl until well combined. Roll mixture into 12 meatballs.</li>
        <li>Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Place meatballs into the hot skillet; cook, turning once halfway through cooking, until well browned, about 8 minutes. Drain and discard excess grease.</li>
        <li>Pour tomato sauce, chicken stock, Worcestershire sauce, and sugar into the skillet; reduce heat to medium-low. Cover and simmer until meatballs are no longer pink in the center and rice is tender, about 45 minutes. Stir in more stock if sauce becomes too dry.

        </li>
       
    </ul>
