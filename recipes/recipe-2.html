    <h2>Recipe</h2>
    <h2>ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 ½ cups milk</li>
        <li>1 (3.5 ounce) package non-instant chocolate pudding mix</li>
        <li>1 cup semisweet chocolate chips</li>
        <li>1 ⅓ cups white sugar</li>
        <li>¾ cup butter, softened </li>
        <li>½ cup shortening</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract </li>
        <li>4 eggs</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Make the filling: In a medium pan, combine 1 1/2 cups milk and pudding mix. Cook as directed on the package. Add chocolate chips and stir until melted. Set aside.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour a 10-inch Bundt or tube pan.</li>
        <li>Make the cake batter: In a large bowl, combine white sugar, butter, and shortening. Beat until light and fluffy. Add vanilla and eggs. Mix well.</li>
        <li>Add flour, 1/2 cup cocoa, baking powder, salt, and 1 cup milk to a bowl. Beat on low speed until moistened. Beat on medium speed for 3 minutes, then stir in walnuts.

        </li>
        <li>Reserve 2 cups of the batter. Pour remaining batter into the prepared pan. Spoon the filling in a ring on top of the batter, making sure it does not touch the sides of the pan. Spoon reserved batter over the filling.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until the cake springs back when touched lightly in the center, 50 to 60 minutes. Cool for 1 hour in the pan, then turn out onto a wire rack and cool completely.

        </li>
        <li>Make the glaze: In a small bowl, combine confectioners' sugar and remaining 1/4 cup cocoa. Stir in enough milk to reach desired drizzling consistency. Spoon glaze over the cooled cake, allowing some to run down the sides.

        </li>

    </ul>
